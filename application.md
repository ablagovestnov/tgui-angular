# Application for Angular UI Components Library for Telegram Mini Apps Bounty

I'm excited to apply for this bounty to develop an Angular UI Components library for Telegram Mini Apps. I've already started implementing the library and would like to share my progress.

## About Me

I have over 15 years of experience in software development with a focus on Angular Frontend applications. Currently, I'm working as a Tech Lead at Rostelecom PJSC (www.company.rt.ru), where I lead development teams on various projects.

I hold a specialist degree in "Mathematics / System Programming", providing me with a strong foundation in both theoretical computer science and practical software development.

## Current Implementation Progress

I've already built a foundational structure for the TGUI Angular library following modern Angular 19+ practices, with:

- A complete theming system that automatically syncs with Telegram's theme
- Platform detection for iOS/Android styling differences
- A component architecture organized by functional categories (blocks, feedback, form, layout, typography)
- Integration with Telegram WebApp API via a dedicated service

You can see a live demonstration of my current implementation at: https://debug.adventure-finder.com/

## Approach & Plans

My implementation follows the Telegram UI Kit design language while leveraging Angular's strengths:

- All components are built as standalone Angular components for modular importing
- The library provides both imperative (service-based) and declarative (component-based) APIs
- Full TypeScript type safety and comprehensive documentation
- Automatic handling of Telegram's theming, viewport changes, and platform-specific styling

## Timeline & Completion Plan

If selected for this bounty, I can deliver the complete library within 2-3 months, including:

1. Full implementation of all Telegram UI Kit components
2. Comprehensive Storybook documentation
3. Interactive demos for each component
4. Full test coverage
5. Publishing to NPM with proper versioning

I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the Telegram Mini Apps ecosystem with this library and would be happy to discuss my implementation approach in more detail.
